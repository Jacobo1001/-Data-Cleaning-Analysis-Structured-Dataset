# 📊 Data Cleaning & Analysis – Structured Dataset

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the design, implementation, and analysis of a structured relational database using a real dataset.  
The main objective was to ensure **data quality**, **proper structure**, and **meaningful analysis** through SQL queries and supporting tools.

This type of work is commonly required before reporting, dashboards, or business decision-making.
